# [wx.Window](https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/wx.Window.html#wx-window)

wx.Window is the base class for all windows and represents any visible object on screen.

All controls, top level windows and so on are windows. Sizers and device contexts are not, however, as they donâ€™t appear on screen themselves.
