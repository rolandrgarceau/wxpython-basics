# Kubernetes to deploy wxpython app 

The system administration side of building a deployment here will be discussed as gRPC generators and binary assimilation of python code for embedding into an image file and released onto a pod or main/single node for PoC, then pushed to more refined resource delegation techniques that follow the 12 factor litmus test notes within this repo.

If you are curious go to the kubernetes and RHEL microservice management notes from within the github system admin notes on my github repo [here]().
