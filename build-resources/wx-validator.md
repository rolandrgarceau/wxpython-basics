# [wx.Validator](https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/validator_overview.html#validator-overview)

wx.Validator is the base class for a family of validator classes that mediate between a class of control, and application data.

## Validator concepts

Used to make plugging into writing dialogs easier. The validator object can be plugged into a wxTextCtrl object and mediates between Python data and the control, transferring the data in either direction and validating it. It also is able to intercept events generated by the control, providing filtering behavior without the need to derive a new control class.

### Gotchas
Note Your wx.Validator sub-class must implement the wx.Validator.Clone method.
Note Note that any wx.Window may have a validator; using the WS_EX_VALIDATE_RECURSIVELY style (see Window extended styles) you can also implement recursive validation.
