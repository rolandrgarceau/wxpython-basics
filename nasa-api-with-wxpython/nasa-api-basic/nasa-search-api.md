Features:

* Search bar
* widget to hold search results
  * watch the "sub-zero" from api_req.py. It is dealing only with one item- the first of many
* Display mechanism when the result is chosen
  * this will affect how we make use of the sub-zero, sub-one, sub-two, as loop or individually (in a minute)

## Deal with layout after you get funding
Series of nested sizers will put them in there for you. Some immediate considerations is what happens when your initial application size is overfilled with too many onjects added to the sizer? Specifically if we are from a HTML/CSS/JS background- how do we address a scrollable window, or can we add in an auto-resize of the entire app? Resize may look like shrinking the widgets added to the sizer to fit, or even growing the "size" of the application to handle the overloaded sizer. I tested this out just because it was a problem I have seen before in other frameworks and how to deal with these design considerations quickly (are you on a sprint with deadline too?) often result in SEO per keyphrase lookup.
