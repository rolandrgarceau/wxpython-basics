# Video Transitions

For Beginners we may choose not to have explination for SIGINT in video. PID1 control handling is a class in itself.

Intermediate we should look back at the time of video and release schedule to see what we are getting ourselves into before choosing a path for long term development with this.

Advanced look at the binary with self healing inlined code rendering. What compiler is packeaged with the version and how are we to grab f_locals.

Went from just typing the three fundamentals- the App, Panel, and Frame. Then after explanation of the args, the video was paused, and explained that there will be a "cleanup". Good way to transition the simple lines of code into their respective constituent classes. Also it becomes clear about the parent of the frame, but we could mention "inheritance" or our own wording in our videos. He offers Corey Schaffer as a tutorial video guy to learn OOP with Python.

## Explain classes 
* how to create the class (hint on organization)
* then what the class will do
  * eg if we need to add panel to frame under frame class we need to create the OnInit function "to do it" after the super call. Do we explain super?

He went on to explaining how to add the frame to the App class with the InitFrame() and passing in the MyFrame Class.

## Use Docstrings

Without more to be said... do it. We can stop here. Time to find a better series?
