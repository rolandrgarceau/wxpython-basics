# [PySimpleGui](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Just a few lines of code is all it takes to use the power of this Gui framework. However, from their documentation it appears the port with PySimpleGui is geared to TKinter, with a few others in beta ,development, and experimental. This allows someone that read down here this far an option to join a community and assist others with their findings. The cookbook and readme can be found at ReadTheDocs.

## wxPython Specific readme

There exists specific documentation for using wxPython with PySimpleGui. The overview GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI).

## Support For Python 2.7 ends

[This](https://pythonclock.org/) talks about it. Know that if you are using 2.7 you will need to Fork the source code by Dec. 31, 2019

## Web Support

PySimpleGui can be used as a desktop GUI, but also can run your GUI in a web browser with PySimpleGUIWeb. For Raspberry PI with "headless" setups this may be what some are looking for. Connection to an application here is by going to the Pi's IP address (and port #) using a browser and you'll be in communication with your application. You can use it to make configuration changes or control robots, hardware, or otherwise using buttons in your GUI.
